# NextFlowAnalysis Pipeline

## Overview
NextFlowGenomics is a robust Nextflow-based workflow designed for high-throughput genomic data analysis. This pipeline automates tasks such as read alignment, variant calling, and data visualization, optimized for both local and cloud environments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/)
- Java 8 or later

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EemanAbbasi/NextFlowGenomics.git
cd NextFlowGenomics
```

### Pipeline Steps
 - Read Alignment: Aligns sequencing reads to a reference genome using BWA.
 - Variant Calling: Calls variants using the aligned BAM files with BCFtools.

### Running the Pipeline
Custom Data and Parameters: You can specify your input data, reference genome, and output directory using command-line parameters:
```bash
nextflow run main.nf --reads 'path/to/your/data/*.fastq' --genome 'path/to/reference/genome.fa' --outdir 'path/to/output'
```

###Advanced Options
For running the pipeline on cloud resources or with high memory requirements, refer to the nextflow.config file where different profiles are configured. To use a specific profile:
```bash
nextflow run main.nf -profile highMemory
```
